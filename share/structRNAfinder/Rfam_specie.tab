RF00001	5S_rRNA	5S ribosomal RNA	Gene; rRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; Archaea; 	5S ribosomal RNA (5S rRNA) is a component of the large ribosomal subunit in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, it is synthesised by RNA polymerase III (the other eukaryotic rRNAs are cleaved from a 45S precursor synthesised by RNA polymerase I). In Xenopus oocytes, it has been shown that fingers 4-7 of the nine-zinc finger transcription factor TFIIIA can bind to the central region of 5S RNA. Thus, in addition to positively regulating 5S rRNA transcription, TFIIIA also stabilises 5S rRNA until it is required for transcription.
RF00002	5_8S_rRNA	5.8S ribosomal RNA	Gene; rRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; Archaea; 	5.8S ribosomal RNA (5.8S rRNA) is a component of the large subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome. It is transcribed by RNA polymerase I as part of the 45S precursor that also contains 18S and 28S rRNA. Functionally, it is thought that 5.8S rRNA may be involved in ribosome translocation [2]. It is also known to form covalent linkage to the p53 tumour suppressor protein [3]. 5.8S rRNA is also found in archaea.
RF00003	U1	U1 spliceosomal RNA	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	Eukaryota; 	U1 is a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the spliceosome (involved in pre-mRNA splicing). Its 5' end forms complementary base pairs with the 5' splice junction, thus defining the 5' donor site of an intron. There are significant differences in sequence and secondary structure between metazoan and yeast U1 snRNAs, the latter being much longer (568 nucleotides as compared to 164 nucleotides in human). Nevertheless, secondary structure predictions suggest that all U1 snRNAs share a 'common core' consisting of helices I, II, the proximal region of III, and IV [1]. This family does not contain the larger yeast sequences.
RF00004	U2	U2 spliceosomal RNA	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	Eukaryota; 	U2 is a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the spliceosome (involved in pre-mRNA splicing). Complementary binding between U2 snRNA (in an area lying towards the 5' end but 3' to hairpin I) and the branchpoint sequence (BPS) of the intron results the bulging out of an unpaired adenosine, on the BPS, which initiates a nucleophilic attack at the intronic 5' splice site, thus starting the first of two transesterification reactions that mediate splicing.
RF00005	tRNA	tRNA	Gene; tRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; Archaea; 	Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are approximately 80 nucleotides in length. Their secondary structure includes four short double-helical elements and three loops (D, anti-codon, and T loops). Further hydrogen bonds mediate the characteristic L-shaped molecular structure. tRNAs have two regions of fundamental functional importance: the anti-codon, which is responsible for specific mRNA codon recognition, and the 3' end, to which the tRNAs corresponding amino acid is attached (by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases). tRNAs cope with the degeneracy of the genetic code in two manners: having more than one tRNA (with a specific anti-codon) for a particular amino acid; and 'wobble' base-pairing, i.e. permitting non-standard base-pairing at the 3rd anti-codon position.
RF00006	Vault	Vault RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; 	This family of RNAs are found as part of the enigmatic vault ribonucleoprotein complex. The complex consists of a major vault protein (MVP), two minor vault proteins (VPARP and TEP1), and several small untranslated RNA molecules. It has been suggested that the vault complex is involved in drug resistance. We have identified a putative novel vault RNA on chromosome 5 EMBL:AC005219.
RF00007	U12	U12 minor spliceosomal RNA	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	Eukaryota; 	The U12 small nuclear (snRNA), together with U4atac/U6atac, U5, and U11 snRNAs and associated proteins, forms a spliceosome that cleaves a divergent class of low-abundance pre-mRNA introns. Although the U12 sequence is very divergent from that of U2 (Rfam:RF00004), the two are functionally analogous [2]. The predicted secondary structure of U12 RNA is published (see for example, PMID:10199569), but the alternative single hairpin in the 3' end shown here seems to better match the alignment of divergent Drosophila and Arabidopsis sequences.
RF00008	Hammerhead_3	Hammerhead ribozyme (type III)	Gene; ribozyme;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; Viroids; 	The hammerhead ribozyme is one of the smallest catalytic RNAs. These RNAs have an endonuclease function, and most often are autocatalytic. Structurally it is composed of three base paired helices, separated by short linkers of conserved sequence. These helices are called I, II and III. We have classified hammerhead ribozymes into three types based on which helix the 5' and 3' ends of the sequence join. This family are the type III hammerheads. The conserved uridine-turn links helix I to helix II and usually has the sequence CUGA. Helix II and III are linked by a sequence CGAAA. The cleavage reaction occurs between helix III and I, and is usually a C. Hammerhead ribozymes are found in plant viroids and other small replicating satellite RNA species. Hammerhead ribozymes have been found in animals as well as plants. This family includes a couple of false matches currently these are EMBL:AC078923 and EMBL:BC050488. These animal sequences are not expected to be hammerhead ribozymes.
RF00009	RNaseP_nuc	Nuclear RNase P	Gene; ribozyme;	Eukaryota; 	Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Its best characterised activity is the generation of mature 5'-ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5'-leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzyme s have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous -- helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.
RF00010	RNaseP_bact_a	Bacterial RNase P class A	Gene; ribozyme;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Its best characterised activity is the generation of mature 5'-ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5'-leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzyme s have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous -- helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.
RF00011	RNaseP_bact_b	Bacterial RNase P class B	Gene; ribozyme;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Its best characterised activity is the generation of mature 5'-ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5'-leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzyme s have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous -- helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.
RF00012	U3	Small nucleolar RNA U3	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in the processing and modification of rRNA in the nucleolus. There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localisation, stability and hyper-methylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.
RF00013	6S	6S / SsrS RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	E. coli 6S RNA was the first non coding RNA to be sequenced, but its function was unknown until recently. It consists of 184 nucleotides that fold into an extended hairpin structure with a large single-stranded internal bulge. The 6S RNA specifically associates with RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the sigma70 specificity factor. This interaction represses expression from a sigma70-dependent promoter during stationary phase [1]. 6S RNA homologs have recently been identified in most bacterial genomes [2,3]. Many Gram-positive species have two copies of 6S RNA. In Bacillus subtilis, both copies appear to interact with RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the housekeeping sigma factor and be expressed during different stages of growth. In many proteobacteria, 6S RNA may be processed from a transcript encoding homologs of the E. coli YgfA protein which is a putative methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase.
RF00014	DsrA	DsrA RNA	Gene; sRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	DsrA RNA regulates both transcription, by overcoming transcriptional silencing by the nucleoid-associated H-NS protein, and translation, by promoting efficient translation of the stress sigma factor, RpoS. These two activities of DsrA can be separated by mutation: the first of three stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide RNA is necessary for RpoS translation but not for anti-H-NS action, while the second stem-loop is essential for antisilencing and less critical for RpoS translation. The third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator, can be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss of either DsrA function. The sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA is complementary with the upstream leader portion of RpoS messenger RNA, suggesting that pairing of DsrA with the RpoS message might be important for translational regulation.
RF00015	U4	U4 spliceosomal RNA	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	Eukaryota; 	U4 small nuclear RNA (U4 snRNA) is a component of the major U2-dependent spliceosome. It forms a duplex with U6, and with each splicing round, it is displaced from U6 (and the spliceosome) in an ATP-dependent manner, allowing U6 to re-fold and create the active site for splicing catalysis. A recycling process involving protein Prp24 re-anneals U4 and U6.
RF00016	SNORD14	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD14	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	U14 small nucleolar RNA (U14 snoRNA) is required for early cleavages of eukaryotic precursor rRNAs. In yeasts, this molecule possess a stem-loop region (known as the Y-domain) which is essential for function. A similar structure, but with a different consensus sequence, is found in plants, but is absent in vertebrates [1].
RF00017	Metazoa_SRP	Metazoan signal recognition particle RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; Archaea; 	The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein. It is involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, as represented by this family. Eight helical elements fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region [1,2]. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP [1]. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54 M domain mediates signal sequence recognition [2,3]. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilises helix 8 for SRP54 binding [1]. The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) [4] provides compilations of SRP components, with phylogenetic data and structural illustrations. Many sequences below the threshold for this family are clearly closely related, but are most likely to be SRP RNA derived pseudogenes. The human genome in particular is known to contain a large amount of SRP RNA related sequence, including Alu repeats. While the threshold of this family is set high so as to minimise the number of hits to such regions, it is likely that some remain.
RF00018	CsrB	CsrB/RsmB RNA family	Gene; sRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	The CsrB RNA binds to approximately 18 copies of the CsrA protein Pfam:PF02599. Although CsrA proteins are found in a wide variety of bacteria, CsrB RNAs are only known in enterobacter. The CsrB RNAs contain a conserved motif CAGGXXG that is found in up to 18 copies and has been suggested to bind CsrA. The Csr regulatory system has a strong negative regulatory effect on glycogen biosynthesis, glyconeogenesis and glycogen catabolism and a positive regulatory effect on glycolysis [1]. In other bacteria such as Erwinia caratovara the RsmA protein has been shown to regulate the production of virulence determinants, such extracellular enzymes [2]. RsmA binds to RsmB regulatory RNA which is also a member of this family [2].
RF00019	Y_RNA	Y RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; 	Y RNAs are components of the Ro ribonucleoprotein particle (Ro RNP), in association with Ro60 and La proteins. The Y RNAs and Ro60 and La proteins are well conserved, but the function of the Ro RNP is not known. In humans the RNA component can be one of four small RNAs -- hY1, hY3, hY4 and hY5. These small RNAs are predicted to fold into a conserved secondary structure containing three stem structures. The largest of the four, hY1, contains an additional hairpin. This family includes a significant number of annotated pseudogenes and the model is expected to discriminate poorly between real and Y RNA related pseudogenes.
RF00020	U5	U5 spliceosomal RNA	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	Eukaryota; 	U5 RNA is a component of both types of known spliceosome. The precise function of this molecule is unknown, though it is known that the 5' loop is required for splice site selection and p220 binding, and that both the 3' stem-loop and the Sm site are important for Sm protein binding and cap methylation.
RF00021	Spot_42	Spot 42 RNA	Gene; sRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	The physiological role of Escherichia coli Spot 42 (spf) RNA has remained obscure, even though the 109-nucleotide RNA was discovered almost three decades ago. Spot 42 seems to have a regulatory role on the galactose operon [1]. It is proposed that Spot 42 acts by an antisense mechanism where the RNA binds to the galK translation initiator region [1]. Changes in Spot 42 levels are implicated in affecting the adjacent DNA polymerase I levels [2]. The Hfq protein has been shown to interact with several small regulatory RNAs in E. coli, and the protein is required for OxyS, DsrA, RprA and Spot 42 RNA regulation [3].
RF00022	GcvB	GcvB RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	The gcvB gene encodes a small untranslated RNA involved in expression of the dipeptide and oligopeptide transport systems in Escherichia coli. Included several unknown homologues in alignment (Bateman A pers obs).
RF00023	tmRNA	transfer-messenger RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; 	Bacterial tmRNA, also known as 10Sa RNA or SsrA, is named for its dual tRNA and mRNA-like properties. Its role is to liberate the mRNA from a stalled ribosome. To accomplish this part of the tmRNA is used as a reading frame that ends in a translation stop signal. The broken mRNA is replaced in the ribosome by the tmRNA and translation of the tmRNA leads to addition of a proteolysis tag to the incomplete protein enabling recognition by a protease. Recently a number of permuted tmRNA genes have been found encoded in two parts. tmRNAs have been identified in eubacteria and some chloroplasts but are absent from archaeal and eukaryote nuclear genomes.
RF00024	Telomerase-vert	Vertebrate telomerase RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; Viruses; 	Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that synthesises telomeric DNA. Telomerase RNAs differ greatly in sequence and structure between vertebrates, ciliates and yeasts, but they share a 5' pseudoknot structure close to the template sequence. Vertebrate telomerase RNAs have a 3' H/ACA snoRNA-like domain. This family also contains viral telomerase RNAs from the Gallid herpes viruses as described in [3].
RF00025	Telomerase-cil	Ciliate telomerase RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; 	Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that synthesises telomeric DNA. Telomerase RNAs differ greatly in sequence and structure between vertebrates, ciliates and yeasts, but they share a 5' pseudoknot structure close to the template sequence.
RF00026	U6	U6 spliceosomal RNA	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	Eukaryota; Viruses; 	U6 snRNA is a component of the spliceosome which is involved in splicing pre-mRNA. The putative secondary structure consensus base pairing is confined to a short 5' stem loop, but U6 snRNA is thought to form extensive base-pair interactions with U4 snRNA [2]. This model hits a large number of sequences in vertebrate genomes, which appear to be U6 derived pseudogenes or repeats. This family has a high significance threshold to minimise this problem, but many annotated pseudogenes remain.
RF00027	let-7	let-7 microRNA precursor	Gene; miRNA;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents the microRNA (miRNA) let-7 and mir-98. let-7 was identified from a study of developmental timing in C. elegans [1], and was later shown to be part of a much larger class of non-coding RNAs termed miRNAs [2]. Both miRNAs let-7 and mir-98 have now been predicted or experimentally confirmed in a wide range of species (MIPF:MIPF000002). miRNAs are transcribed as ~70nt precursors (modelled here) and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22nt product. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA. The involvement of Dicer in miRNA processing suggests a relationship with the phenomenon of RNA interference. This family also includes the miR-98 precursor from human, which may be a let-7 homologue.
RF00028	Intron_gpI	Group I catalytic intron	Intron;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; 	Group I catalytic introns are large self-splicing ribozymes. They catalyse their own excision from mRNA, tRNA and rRNA precursors in a wide range of organisms. The core secondary structure consists of 9 paired regions (P1-P9). These fold to essentially two domains - the P4-P6 domain (formed from the stacking of P5, P4, P6 and P6a helices) and the P3-P9 domain (formed from the P8, P3, P7 and P9 helices). The secondary structure mark-up for this family represents only this conserved core. Group I catalytic introns often have long ORFs inserted in loop regions. The window size for this search is chosen to minimise search time and catch the small examples. A larger window size will find more matches.
RF00029	Intron_gpII	Group II catalytic intron	Intron;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; Archaea; 	Group II introns are found in rRNA, tRNA and mRNA of organelles in fungi, plants and protists, and also in mRNA in bacteria. They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI. This model and alignment represents only domains V and VI. A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB which differ in splice site consensus, distance of bulged A from 3' splice site, some tertiary interactions, and intronic ORF phylogeny [1].
RF00030	RNase_MRP	RNase MRP	Gene; ribozyme;	Eukaryota; 	RNase MRP is an enzymatically active ribonucleoprotein with two distinct roles in eukaryotes. In mitochondria it plays a direct role in the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication. In the nucleus it is involved in precursor rRNA processing, where it cleaves the internal transcribed spacer 1 between 18S and 5.8S rRNAs. Despite distinct functions, RNase MRP has been shown to be evolutionarily related to RNase P. Like eukaryotic RNase P, RNase MRP is not catalytically active without associated protein subunits.
RF00031	SECIS_1	Selenocysteine insertion sequence 1	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; 	The incorporation of selenocysteine into a protein sequence is directed by an in-frame UGA codon (usually a stop codon) within the coding region of the mRNA. Selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved secondary structure in the 3' UTR that is required for the distinction of UGA stop from UGA selenocysteine. The selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) is around 60 nt in length and adopts a hairpin structure which is sufficiently well-defined and conserved to act as a computational screen for selenoprotein genes [2].
RF00032	Histone3	Histone 3' UTR stem-loop	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; Archaea; 	The mRNAs of metazoan histone genes lack a poly-A tail. 3' end processing occurs at a site between a highly conserved stem-loop (modelled by this family) and a purine rich region around 20 nts downstream (the histone downstream element, or HDE). The stem-loop is bound by a 31 kDa stem-loop binding protein (SLBP - also termed the histone hairpin binding protein, or HBP). Together with U7 snRNA binding of the HDE, SLBP binding nucleate s the formation of the processing complex. The histone 3' UTR stem-loop is also involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport of the mRNA, and in stability regulation and translation efficiency in the cytoplasm.
RF00033	MicF	MicF RNA	Gene; antisense;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	The micF gene is a stress response gene found in Escherichia coli and related bacteria that post-transcriptionally controls expression of the outer membrane porin gene ompF. The micF gene encodes a non-translated 93 nt antisense RNA that binds its target ompF mRNA and regulates ompF expression by inhibiting translation and inducing degradation of the message. In addition, other factors, such as the RNA chaperone protein StpA also play a role in this regulatory system. Expression of micF is controlled by both environmental and internal stress factors. Four transcriptional regulators are known to bind the micF promoter region and activate micF expression.
RF00034	RprA	RprA RNA	Gene; sRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	Translational regulation of the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS is mediated by the formation of a double-stranded RNA stem-loop structure in the upstream region of the rpoS messenger RNA, occluding the translation initiation site. Clones carrying rprA (RpoS regulator RNA A) increased the translation of RpoS. The rprA gene encodes a 106 nucleotide regulatory RNA. As with DsrA Rfam:RF00014, RprA is predicted to form three stem-loops. Thus, at least two small RNAs, DsrA and RprA, participate in the positive regulation of RpoS translation. RprA also appears to bind to the RpoS leader [2]. RprA is non-essential [1]. The Y. pestis homologue was detected by similarity to the E. coli gene (pers obs. Bateman A).
RF00035	OxyS	OxyS RNA	Gene; sRNA;	Bacteria; 	OxyS is a small untranslated RNA which is induced in response to oxidative stress in Escherichia coli. This novel RNA acts as a global regulator to activate or repress the expression of as many as 40 genes, including the fhlA-encoded transcriptional activator and the rpoS-encoded sigma(s) subunit of RNA polymerase [1]. OxyS is bound by the Hfq protein, that increases the OxyS RNA interaction with its target messages [2].
RF00036	RRE	HIV Rev response element	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; 	The Rev response element (RRE) is encoded within the HIV-env gene. Rev is an essential regulatory protein of HIV that binds an internal loop of the RRE leading, encouraging further Rev-RRE binding. This RNP complex is critical for mRNA export and hence for expression of the HIV structural proteins.
RF00037	IRE_I	Iron response element I	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	\N
RF00038	PrfA	PrfA thermoregulator UTR	Cis-reg; thermoregulator;	Bacteria; 	In Listeria monocytogenes, virulence genes are maximally expressed at 37 degrees C, almost silent at 30 degrees C and controlled by PrfA, a transcriptional activator whose expression is thermoregulated. It has been shown that the untranslated mRNA (UTR) preceding prfA, forms a secondary structure, which masks the ribosome binding region [1]. This family also contains UTRs from other closely related bacteria. The secondary structure of this motif forms a hairpin. The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence is partly masked by the most conserved stem of the secondary structure. It is thought that at 37 degrees C the SD sequence is unmasked [1].
RF00039	DicF	DicF RNA	Gene; antisense;	Bacteria; 	DicF RNA is an antisense inhibitor of cell division gene ftsZ [1].
RF00040	rne5	RNase E 5' UTR element	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	This family represents a conserved element found in the 5' UTR of RNase E mRNA. RNase E is a key regulatory enzyme in the pathway of mRNA degradation in E. coli that is able to auto-regulate the degradation of its own mRNA in response to changes in RNase E activity. This rne 5' UTR element acts as a sensor of cellular RNase E concentration enabling tight regulation of RNase E concentration and synthesis.
RF00041	Entero_OriR	Enteroviral 3' UTR element	Cis-reg;	Viruses; 	This RNA structure is found in the 3' UTR of various enteroviruses. The overall structure forms the origin of replication (OriR) for the initiation of (-) strand RNA synthesis [1]. Pseudoknots have also been predicted in this structure [1].
RF00042	CopA	CopA-like RNA	Gene; antisense;	Bacteria; 	In several groups of bacterial plasmids, antisense RNAs regulate copy number through inhibition of replication initiator protein synthesis. These RNAs are characterised by a long hairpin structure interrupted by several unpaired residues or bulged loops. In plasmid R1, the inhibitory complex between the antisense RNA (CopA) and its target mRNA (CopT) is characterised by a four-way junction structure and a side-by-side helical alignment [3].
RF00043	Plasmid_R1162	R1162-like plasmid antisense RNA	Gene; antisense;	Bacteria; 	The copy-number of the broad host-range plasmid R1162 is controlled by the amounts of two proteins, encoded by cotranscribed genes comprising a region of the plasmid called RepI. RepI is negatively regulated by a 75 base RNA that is complementary to a segment of the RepI message [1].
RF00044	Phage_pRNA	Bacteriophage pRNA	Gene;	Viruses; 	During replication of linear dsDNA viruses, the viral genome is packaged into the pre-formed viral procapsid. The packaging of DNA into the procapsid requires a molecular motor which using ATP as energy to accomplish the energetically unfavourable motion. In some bacteriophage, an RNA (pRNA) molecule is a vital component of this motor [1]. Structural analyses of the packaging motor have demonstrated that the pRNA molecule has fivefold symmetry when attached to the prohead [2-4]. The pRNA is thought to be bound by the capsid connector protein (PFAM:PF05352) [4]. Only the first 120 bases of the pRNA are essential for packing the viral DNA [5,6]. The pRNA is proposed to be comprised of two domains, one corresponding to the first 120 bases and the second to the remaining 50 bases [6]. Nuclear cleavage occurs in the single strand region linking these two domains [6].
RF00045	SNORA73	Small nucleolar RNA SNORA73 family	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; HACA-box;	Eukaryota; 	U17 (SNORA73A and SNORA73B) also known as E1 belongs to the H/ACA class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Vertebrate U17 is intron-encoded and ranges in length from 200-230 nucleotides, longer than most snoRNAs. It is one of the most abundant snoRNAs in human cells and is essential for the cleavage of pre-rRNA within the 5' external transcribed spacer (ETS) [1]. This cleavage leads to the formation of 18S rRNA. Regions of the U17 RNA are complementary to rRNA and act as guides for RNA/RNA interactions, although these regions do not seem to be well conserved between organisms [2].

RF00047	mir-2	mir-2 microRNA precursor	Gene; miRNA;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents the microRNA (miRNA) precursors mir-2 and mir-13 (MIPF:MIPF0000049). mir-2 has now been predicted or experimentally confirmed in a wide range of species. The miRNAs are transcribed as ~70nt precursors (modelled here) and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22nt product. In this case the mature sequence comes from the 3' arm of the precursor. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA. The involvement of Dicer in miRNA processing suggests a relationship with the phenomenon of RNA interference. miRNAs are numbered based on the mature sequence. This family also contains the mir-13 precursor which, despite giving rise to a distinct mature sequence appears to be related in sequence.

This process is initiated by the covalent attachment of UMP to the terminal protein VPg, yielding VPgpU and VPgpUpU. A small RNA hairpin in the coding region of protein 2C as the site in PV1(M) RNA that is used as the primary template for the in vitro uridylylation [1-2].

U36 is encoded within the intron of rpL7a, and has two regions of complementarity to 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA. This complementarity suggests that U36 acts as a 2'-O-ribose methylation guide [1,2]. This family also contains snoR47, which has been shown to be homologous to U36 [2], and plant Z100 snoRNA.
RF00050	FMN	FMN riboswitch (RFN element)	Cis-reg; riboswitch;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Archaea; 	The RFN element is a highly conserved domain that is found frequently in the 5'-untranslated regions of prokaryotic mRNAs that encode for flavin mononucleotide (FMN) biosynthesis and transport proteins. This element is a metabolite-dependent riboswitch that directly binds FMN in the absence of proteins. In Bacillus subtilis, the riboswitch most likely controls gene expression by causing premature transcription termination within the 5' untranslated region of the ribDEAHT operon and precluding access to the ribosome-binding site of ypaA mRNA [3].

The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA. The involvement of Dicer in miRNA processing suggests a relationship with the phenomenon of RNA interference.

Z37 acts as a methylation guide for 5.8S ribosomal RNA. This family contains a putative snoRNA found in the intron of the receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1) gene in mammals (S. Griffiths-Jones, pers. obs.). This family also includes human snoRNAs U96a (SNORD96A) and U96b (SNORD96B) and the apicomplexan snoRNA snr39b.
RF00056	SNORA71	Small nucleolar RNA SNORA71	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; HACA-box;	Eukaryota; 	The members of this family belong to the H/ACA class of snoRNAs which bind a number of proteins (including dyskerin, Gar1p and Nop10p) to form snoRNP complexes.

This family includes U71 (SNORA71), ACA39 (SNORA39) and ACA60 (SNORA60) [1,3]. U71 and ACA60 are predicted to guide the pseudouridylation of U406 and U1004 in 18S rRNA respectively [4]. There is currently no target RNA identified for ACA39 [3].
RF00057	RyhB	RyhB RNA	Gene; sRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	The RyhB 90-nt RNA down-regulates a set of iron-storage and iron-using proteins when iron is limiting; it is itself negatively regulated by the ferric uptake repressor protein, Fur (Ferric uptake regulator). RyhB RNA levels are inversely correlated with mRNA levels for the sdhCDAB operon, encoding succinate dehydrogenase, as well as five other genes previously shown to be positively regulated by Fur by an unknown mechanism. These include two other genes encoding enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, acnA and fumA, two ferritin genes, ftnA and bfr, and a gene for superoxide dismutase, sodB [1]. This ncRNA gene was recently identified in a screen and called SraI and was found to be expressed only in stationary phase [2].

RF00059	TPP	TPP riboswitch (THI element)	Cis-reg; riboswitch;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Archaea; 	Vitamin B(1) in its active form thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) is an essential coenzyme that is synthesised by coupling of pyrimidine and thiazole moieties in bacteria. The previously detected thiamin-regulatory element, thi box [1] was extended, resulting in a new, highly conserved RNA secondary structure, the THI element, which is widely distributed in eubacteria and also occurs in some archaea. Analysis of operon structures identified a large number of new candidate thiamin-regulated genes, mostly transporters, in various prokaryotic organisms [2]. The THI element is a riboswitch [3] that directly binds to TPP to regulate gene expression through a variety of mechanisms in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes [4,5].

RF00061	IRES_HCV	Hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site	Cis-reg; IRES;	Viruses; 	Protein translation of most eukaryotic mRNAs requires association of Met-tRNA, several initiation factors, and GTP with the 40S ribosomal subunit. The ribosome can only bind the capped mRNA after binding the initiator tRNA. Translation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) mRNA is initiated by a different mechanism from the usual 5' cap-binding model [2]. This alternate mechanism relies on the direct binding of the 40S ribosomal subunit by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5' UTR of HCV RNA. HCV IRES adopts a complex structure, and may differ significantly from IRES elements identified in picornaviruses. A small number of eukaryotic mRNA have been shown to be translated by internal ribosome entry [3].

In a recent experimental screen for ncRNAs in A. fulgidus, this locus was identified as the second-most abundant transcript (Afu-4) (T.-H. Tang, J.-P. Bachellerie, H. Huber, M. Drungowski, T. Elge, J. Brosius, and A. Hüttenhofer, personal communication in [1]).

RF00066	U7	U7 small nuclear RNA	Gene; snRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	Animal histone pre-mRNAs are spliced by a different mechanism than nuclear pre-mRNAs and self-splicing introns. This processing involves the U7 snRNP, which contains only one RNA species: U7. The 5' end of U7 RNA is thought to base-pair to a conserved spacer element downstream of the cleavage site in histone pre-mRNA. This family contains a number of annotated U7 pseudogenes.

RF00068	SNORD21	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD21	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	U21 is a member of the C/D class of snoRNA which contain the C (UGAUGA) and D (CUGA) box motifs. U21 is encoded within an intron of the gene for ribosomal protein L5 in mammals [1], but within introns of the ADP ribosylation factor gene in Drosophila [2]. U21 snoRNA has a 13 nt region of complementarity with an invariant region of eukaryotic 28S ribosomal RNA.
RF00069	SNORD24	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD24	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	U24 is a member of the C/D class of snoRNA which contain the C (UGAUGA) and D (CUGA) box motifs [1]. C/D box snoRNAs have been shown to act as methylation guides for a number of RNA targets [2,3]. U24 is encoded within an intron of the gene for ribosomal protein L7a in mammals, chicken and Fugu [4]. The U76 snoRNA is found in an intron of the uRNA host gene (UHG) growth arrest specific 5 (GAS5) transcript gene [5]. snoRNAs Z20 and U76 snoRNAs show clear similarity to U24.
RF00070	SNORD29	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD29	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	U29 is a member of the C/D class of snoRNA which contain the C (UGAUGA) and D (CUGA) box motifs. Most of the members of the box C/D family function in directing site-specific 2'-O-methylation of substrate RNAs [1].

U73 is encoded within the introns of ribosomal protein S3a and contains a 12nt region of complementarity to a conserved sequence in 28S ribosomal RNA. U73 is therefore thought to function as a 2'-O-ribose methylation guide for pre-rRNA.
RF00072	SNORA75	Small nucleolar RNA SNORA75	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; HACA-box;	Eukaryota; 	U23 belongs to the H/ACA class of snoRNAs. snoRNAs bind a number of proteins (including dyskerin, Gar1p and Nop10p in the case of the H/ACA class) to form snoRNP complexes.

This miRNA has now been predicted or experimentally confirmed in a wide range of plant species (MIPF:MIPF0000004). Animal miRNAs are transcribed as ~70nt precursors and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22nt product. In plants the precursor sequences may be longer, and the carpel factory (caf) enzyme appears to be involved in processing. In this case the mature sequence comes from the 3' arm of the precursor, and both Arabidopsis and rice genomes contain a number of related miRNA precursors which give rise to almost identical mature sequences. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA.

In this case the mature sequence comes from the 5' arm of the precursor. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA. The involvement of Dicer in miRNA processing suggests a relationship with the phenomenon of RNA interference. miRNAs are numbered based on the sequence of the mature RNA.

RF00084	CsrC	CsrC RNA family	Gene; sRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	The 245 nucleotide sRNA of Escherichia coli, CsrC, was discovered using a genetic screen for factors that regulate glycogen biosynthesis. CsrC RNA binds multiple copies of CsrA Pfam:PF02599, a protein that post-transcriptionally regulates central carbon flux, biofilm formation and motility in E. coli. CsrC antagonises the regulatory effects of CsrA, presumably by sequestering this protein. The discovery of CsrC is intriguing, in that a similar sRNA, CsrB, performs essentially the same function. Both sRNAs possess similar imperfect repeat sequences (18 in CsrB, nine in CsrC), primarily localised in the loops of predicted hairpins, which may serve as CsrA binding elements. Transcription of csrC increases as the culture approaches the stationary phase of growth and is indirectly activated by CsrA via the response regulator UvrY [1]. This RNA was also discovered in E. coli during a large scale screen [2]. The gene called SraK, was highly abundant in stationary phase, but low levels could be detected in exponentially growing cells as well [2].

This class are thought to guide the sites of modification of uridines to pseudouridines by forming direct base pairing interactions with substrate RNAs [1]. Targets may include ribosomal and spliceosomal RNAs but the exact functions of many snoRNAs, including U19, are not confirmed. Co-precipitation of U19 snoRNA with RNase MRP RNA suggests that U19 may be involved in pre-rRNA processing [2].

RF00100	7SK	7SK RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; Viruses; 	7SK was discovered as an abundant small nuclear RNA in the mid-70s but a possible function has only recently been suggested [1]. Two independent studies have found that 7SK RNA binds the CDK9/cyclin T complex (known as elongation factor P-TEFb). P-TEFb activates transcription by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. This process is negatively regulated by the 7SK RNP. The secondary structure of 7SK RNA shown here was proposed by Wasserman and Steitz on the basis of chemical modification and enzymatic cleavage experiments [2]. This family contains a number of annotated pseudogenes and 7SK derived repeats. The threshold is artificially high to minimise the pseudogene count.

In this case the mature sequence comes from the 3' arm of the precursor. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA.

RF00106	RNAI	RNAI	Gene; antisense;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; 	RNAI is an antisense repressor of the replication of some E. coli plasmids, including ColE1. Plasmid replication is usually initiated by RNAII, which acts as a primer by binding to its template DNA. The complementary RNAI binds RNAII prohibiting it from its initiation role. The rate of degradation of RNAI is therefore a major factor in control of plasmid replication. This rate of degradation is aided by the pcnB (plasmid copy number B) gene product, which polyadenylates the 3' end of RNAI targeting it for degradation by PNPase. Please note: This family contains subsequences annotated as human (Z96734), Arabidopsis (AB003142), Xenopus (X91243) and S. pombe (L25927, L25928), which match with highly significant scores.

The expression of this sRNA has been shown to be tightly controlled by the cyclic AMP receptor protein, CRP and has been renamed CyaR (cyclic AMP-activated RNA)[2].

RF00166	PrrB_RsmZ	PrrB/RsmZ RNA family	Gene; sRNA;	Bacteria; 	PrrB RNA is able to phenotypically complement gacS and gacA mutants and is itself regulated by the GacS-GacA two-component signal transduction system [1]. Inactivation of the prrB gene in Pseudomonas fluorescens F113 resulted in a significant reduction of 2, 4-diacetylphloroglucinol (Phl) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production, while increased metabolite production was observed when prrB was overexpressed [1]. The prrB gene sequence contains a number of imperfect repeats of the consensus sequence 5'-AGGA-3', and sequence analysis predicted a complex secondary structure featuring multiple putative stem-loops with the consensus sequences predominantly positioned at the single-stranded regions at the ends of the stem-loops. This structure is similar to the CsrB and RsmB regulatory RNAs Rfam:RF00018 [1], suggesting this RNA also interacts with a CsrA-like protein.
RF00167	Purine	Purine riboswitch	Cis-reg; riboswitch;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	Riboswitches are metabolite binding domains within certain messenger RNAs that serve as precision sensors for their corresponding targets. Allosteric rearrangement of mRNA structure is mediated by ligand binding, and this results in modulation of gene expression. A class of riboswitches that selectively recognises guanine and becomes saturated at concentrations as low as 5 nM. In Bacillus subtilis, this mRNA motif is located on at least five separate transcriptional units that together encode 17 genes that are mostly involved in purine transport and purine nucleotide biosynthesis. It has also been shown that some members of this family are specific for adenine instead. Hence this family are termed purine riboswitches.
RF00168	Lysine	Lysine riboswitch	Cis-reg; riboswitch;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	Riboswitches are metabolite binding domains within certain messenger RNAs that serve as precision sensors for their corresponding targets. Allosteric rearrangement of mRNA structure is mediated by ligand binding, and this results in modulation of gene expression. This family includes riboswitches that sense lysine [1] in a number of genes involved in lysine metabolism, including lysC [3].
RF00169	Bacteria_small_SRP	Bacterial small signal recognition particle RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Archaea; 	The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA (RFAM:RF00017) and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most bacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) have a longer eukaryote-like SRP RNA that includes an Alu domain [2]. The Alu domain of the longer SRP RNAs is not included in this model and therefore the reported bounds of some members are incorrect. The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) [1] provides compilations of SRP components, with phylogenetic data and structural illustrations.
RF00170	msr	Retron msr RNA	Gene;	Bacteria; 	Retron elements are found in a wide range of mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The retron encodes a reverse transcriptase that is responsible for the production of a small satellite DNA called msDNA (multi-copy single-stranded DNA). msDNA has both DNA (encoded by the retron msd gene) and RNA (encoded by the msr gene) components. The 5' end of msDNA is linked to an internal guanosine residue of the RNA strand by a 2'-5' linkage. The components of msDNA are poorly conserved in sequence between different organisms -- this family therefore represents only a subset of known msr genes. Despite considerable investigation, very little is known about the function of msDNA, the mobility of retron elements, or their effect on the host cell.
RF00171	Tombus_5	Tombusvirus 5' UTR	Cis-reg;	Viruses; 	Tomato bushy stunt virus is the prototype member of the Tombusviridae family. In addition to viral proteins p33 and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase p92, and unknown host factors, RNA signals within the UTRs are necessary for genome replication. 2 RNA domains in the 5' UTR have been reported [1,2], a 5' T-shaped domain (TSD) followed by a stem-loop (SL5) and a downstream domain (DSD). These domains are combined into a single family here. Reference [2] proposes that TSD-DSD interactions are involved in the mediation of viral RNA replication. The full alignment of this family contains a number of defective interfering (DI) deletion mutants, used to study RNA virus replication.
RF00172	CAESAR	ctgf/hcs24 CAESAR	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; 	The 3' UTR of human connective tissue growth factor/hypertrophic chondrocyte specific 24 (ctgf/hcs24) mRNA has been shown to repress ctgf gene expression [1]. Reference [2] identified a minimal RNA element, predicted to form a stable secondary structure, which acts as a post-transcriptional cis-acting element of structure-anchored repression (CAESAR), probably through direct interactions with as yet unknown nuclear factors.
RF00173	Hairpin	Hairpin ribozyme	Gene; ribozyme;	Viruses; 	The hairpin ribozyme, like the hammerhead (RFAM:RF00008 and RFAM:RF00163), is found in RNA satellites of plant viruses. It was first identified in the minus strand of the tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) satellite RNA where it catalyses a self-cleavage reaction to process the products of rolling circle virus replication to unit-length satellite RNA. The structure consists of 2 domains, A and B. The 3' arm of domain A, which closes helices 1 and 2, contains the cleavage site and is linked to helix 3 of domain B by a linker of variable length and sequence. This region is thus not included in this family. The hairpin ribozyme has been identified in only 3 plant satellite RNAs -- from TRSV, chicory yellow mottle virus (CYMV) and arabis mosaic virus (ARMV).
RF00174	Cobalamin	Cobalamin riboswitch	Cis-reg; riboswitch;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; 	Riboswitches are metabolite binding domains within certain messenger RNAs that serve as precision sensors for their corresponding targets. Allosteric rearrangement of mRNA structure is mediated by ligand binding, and this results in modulation of gene expression [1]. This family represents a cobalamin riboswitch (B12-element) which is widely distributed in 5' UTRs of vitamin B(12)-related genes in bacteria. Cobalamin in the form of adenosylcobalamin (Ado-CBL) is known to repress expression of genes for vitamin B(12) biosynthesis and be transported by a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, which involves direct binding of Ado-CBL to 5' UTRs [2].
RF00175	HIV-1_DIS	Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 dimerisation initiation site	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; Viruses; 	This cis element is composed of four hairpins called SL1 to SL4 (SL is for Stem Loop). This element is involved in encapsidation of the retroviral RNA an essential step in replication [1-3]. It is found in HIV, SIV and CIV. It has been shown that SL1 may provide a secondary binding site for Rev [4]. SL1 [5], SL2 [6], SL3 [7] and SL4 [8] have been independently expressed and structurally characterised.
RF00176	Tombus_3_IV	Tombusvirus 3' UTR region IV	Cis-reg;	Viruses; 	Tomato bushy stunt virus is the prototype member of the Tombusviridae family. In addition to viral proteins p33 and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase p92, and unknown host factors, RNA signals within the UTRs are necessary for genome replication. This element contains a pseudoknot [2].
RF00177	SSU_rRNA_bacteria	Bacterial small subunit ribosomal RNA	Gene; rRNA;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Viruses; Archaea; Viroids; 	\N
RF00178	mir-24	mir-24 microRNA precursor family	Gene; miRNA;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents the microRNA (miRNA) mir-24 family. miRNAs are transcribed as ~70nt precursors (modelled here) and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22nt product. In this case the mature sequence comes from the 3' arm of the precursor. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA. The involvement of Dicer in miRNA processing suggests a relationship with the phenomenon of RNA interference. miRNAs are numbered based on the sequence of the mature RNA. miR-24 has been identified in human and mouse [1].
RF00179	GAIT	GAIT element	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents a cis-acting element in the 3'-UTR of the ceruloplasmin (Cp) gene called gamma interferon inhibitor of translation (GAIT). The GAIT element is involved in selective translational silencing of the Cp transcript. Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a multifunctional, copper-containing glycoprotein produced by the liver and secreted into the plasma. As an acute-phase protein, its plasma concentration can double during multiple inflammatory conditions. Plasma Cp has been reported to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis, carotid restenosis after endarterectomy, and myocardial infarction. Translational silencing of Cp, and possibly other transcripts, mediated by the GAIT element may contribute to the resolution of the local inflammatory response following cytokine activation of macrophages [1].
RF00180	REN-SRE	Renin stability regulatory element (REN-SRE)	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents a cis-acting element in the 3'-UTR of the renin (REN) gene called renin stability regulatory element (REN-SRE) which acts to regulate renin production. REN-SRE is thought to destabilise the mRNA, promoting degradation of the sequence. It has been found that a number of proteins bind to the REN-SRE to stabilise the mRNA and promote translation. Renin is secreted by renal juxtaglomerular cells and catalyses the conversion of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I which is the rate-limiting step in the production of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II induces hypertension and REN therefore requires tight control to ensure expression appropriate to need [1].
RF00181	SNORD113	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD113/SNORD114 family	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	The imprinted human domain at 14q32 contains two clusters of tandemly repeated small nucleolar RNAs named 14q(I) and 14q(II) snoRNAs. These two clusters are named SNORD113 and SNORD114 respectively in the HGNC approved gene symbol nomenclature. The snoRNAs found in both clusters are clearly related and are represented here by a single family. These snoRNAs are intron encoded and are processed from the tissue-specific non-coding human MEG8 RNA, which lies downstream of the imprinted genes DLK1 and GTL2. snoRNAs 14q(I) and 14q(II) differ from previously identified C/D box snoRNAs in their expression profiles and lack of complementarity to rRNA and snRNA. Homologues of these snoRNAs are found in the imprinted non-coding mouse transcript Rian, and in the rat non-coding Bsr (brain-specific repetitive) RNA.
RF00182	Corona_package	Coronavirus packaging signal	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; Viruses; 	This family represents a predicted coronavirus packaging signal. Within a virally infected cell, viral genome and viral proteins specifically and selectively unite into progeny viruses [2]. This process is called packaging and is vital for viral replication. Viral RNA containing a packaging signal allows the sequence to be efficiently packaged into the virion [1].
RF00183	G-CSF_SLDE	G-CSF factor stem-loop destabilising element (SLDE)	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor stem-loop destabilising element (G-CSF SLDE). G-CSF is secreted by fibroblasts and endothelial cells in response to the inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor alpha and by activated macrophages. The synthesis of G-CSF is regulated both transcriptionally and through control of mRNA stability. In unstimulated cells G-CSF mRNA is unstable but becomes stabilised in response to IL-1 or tumour necrosis factor alpha, and also in the case of monocytes and macrophages, in response to lipopolysaccharide. It is likely that the presence of the SLDE in the G-CSF mRNA contributes to the specificity of regulation of G-CSF mRNA and enhances the rate of shortening of the poly(A) tail [1].
RF00184	PVX_3	Potato virus X cis-acting regulatory element	Cis-reg;	Viruses; 	This family represents a cis-acting regulatory element which is found in the 3' UTR of the Potato virus X genome. This element has been found to be required for minus strand RNA accumulation and is therefore essential for efficient viral replication [1].
RF00185	Flavi_CRE	Flavivirus 3' UTR cis-acting replication element (CRE)	Cis-reg;	Viruses; 	This family represents the Flavivirus 3'-SL cis-acting replication element (CRE). The family is thought to play a crucial role in replication and is thought to be needed for the formation of a "replication complex" [1]. Although evidence has been presented for an existence of a pseudoknot structure in this RNA [2], it does not appear to be well conserved across flaviviruses. Deletions of the 3' UTR of flaviviruses have been shown to be lethal for infectious clones.
RF00186	SNORD101	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD101	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	snoRNA U101 is a member of the C/D class of snoRNA which contain the C (UGAUGA) and D (CUGA) box motifs and guide the 2'-O-methylation of rRNA and snRNAs. The precise target of this family is unknown [1].
RF00187	SNORD102	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD102	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	snoRNA U102 is a member of the C/D class of snoRNA which contain the C (UGAUGA) and D (CUGA) box motifs. It is found within intron 3 of the L21 ribosomal protein gene. The H/ACA box snoRNA ACA27 is found in the same host gene within a different intron [1]. This family is predicted to direct a highly conserved 2'-O-methylation in 28S rRNA [2].
RF00188	SNORD103	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD103/SNORD85	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	This family includes the snoRNAs SNORD103 (U103) and SNORD85 (HBII-251) . The members of this family belong to the C/D class of snoRNAs which contain the C (UGAUGA) and D (CUGA) box motifs. In the human genome, there are two identical copies of SNORD103 (SNORD103A and SNORD103B) which share the same host gene with SNORD85. All three snoRNAs are predicted to guide the 2'O-ribose methylation of 18S rRNA G601 [3].
RF00189	SNORD95	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD95	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	snoRNA U95 (also referred to as Z38 ) is a member of the C/D class of snoRNA which contain the C (UGAUGA) and D (CUGA) box motifs. This family is predicted to target two neighbouring 2'-O-methylations, Cm2801 and Am2792, in 28S rRNA [1].
RF00190	SNORA16	Small nucleolar RNA SNORA16B/SNORA16A family	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; HACA-box;	Eukaryota; 	The members of this family belong to the H/ACA class of snoRNAs which are predicted to guide the sites of modification of uridines to pseudouridines [2]. This family includes human snoRNAs U98b (SNORA16B) and ACA16 (SNORA16A) [1,2]. There are currently no predicted targets RNAs for either of these snoRNAs [1,2].
RF00191	SNORA57	Small nucleolar RNA SNORA57	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; HACA-box;	Eukaryota; 	U99 belongs to the H/ACA class of snoRNAs which are thought to guide the sites of modification of uridines to pseudouridines, the target for this family is unknown [1].

RF00193	CTV_rep_sig	Citrus tristeza virus replication signal	Cis-reg;	Viruses; 	This family represents a predicted replication signal which is highly conserved in citrus tristeza viruses. Replication signals are required for viral replication and are usually found near the 5' and 3' termini. This family is predicted to form ten stem loop structures some of which are essential for functions that provide for efficient viral replication [1].
RF00194	Rubella_3	Rubella virus 3' cis-acting element	Cis-reg;	Viruses; 	This family represents a cis-acting element found at the 3' UTR in the rubella virus. This family contains three conserved step loop structures. Pfam:PF00262 (CAL) which is known to bind calcium in most eukaryotic cells, is able to specifically bind to the first stem loop. CAL binding is thought to be related to viral pathogenesis and in particular arthritis which is a occurs frequently in rubella infections in adults and is independent of viral viability. All stem loop structures are thought to be important for efficient viral replication and deletion of stem loop three is known to be lethal [1].
RF00195	RsmY	RsmY RNA family	Gene; sRNA;	Bacteria; 	The rsmY gene, like rsmZ (Rfam:RF00166), is regulated by the GacS/GacA signal transduction system in the plant-beneficial soil bacterium and biocontrol model organism Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0. GacA/GacS target genes are translationally repressed by the small RNA binding protein RsmA. RsmY and RsmZ RNAs bind RsmA to relieve this repression and so enhance secondary metabolism and biocontrol traits [1].
RF00196	AMV_RNA1_SL	Alfalfa mosaic virus RNA 1 5' UTR stem-loop	Cis-reg;	Viruses; 	This family represents a putative stem-loop structure found in the 5' UTR in RNA 1 of alfalfa mosaic virus. RNA 1 is responsible for encoding the viral replicase protein P1. This family is required for negative strand RNA synthesis in in the alfalfa mosaic virus and may also be involved in positive strand RNA synthesis [1].
RF00198	SL1	SL1 RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents the SL1 RNA. SL1 is commonly located in the spacer region between 5S-rRNA genes where it is involved in trans-splicing. Trans-splicing is a form of RNA processing. The acquisition of a spliced leader from a SL RNA is a intra-molecular reaction which precisely joins exons derived from separately transcribed RNAs. This mechanism of mRNA maturation has been shown to occur in a number of lower eukaryotes and is commonplace in nematodes [1].
RF00199	SL2	SL2 RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents SL2 RNA. SL2 RNA is involved in trans splicing in lower eukaryotes. Trans-splicing is a form of RNA processing. The acquisition of a spliced leader from a SL RNA is a intra-molecular reaction which precisely joins exons derived from separately transcribed RNAs [2]. Approximately 25% of C. elegans genes are organised into polycistronic transcription units and the presence of SL2 on an mRNA is an indication the the gene is in an operon [1].
RF00200	snoZ199	Small nucleolar RNA Z199	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	snoZ199 is a C/D box small nucleolar RNA, which acts as a methylation guide RNA for sites on 18S and 25S rRNA. Rice snoZ199 is reported to be homologous to Arabidopsis snoR13.

The 18S methylation site is reported to be homologous to that targeted by U62 in humans (Rfam:RF00153) [1], but the snoRNA sequence similarity is not significant.
RF00206	U54	Small nucleolar RNA U54	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	U54 is a C/D box small nucleolar RNA, which acts as a methylation guide for 18S ribosomal RNA in plants [1].

The pestivirus IRES allows cap and end-independent translation of mRNA in the host cell. The IRES achieves this by mediating the internal initiation of translation by recruiting a ribosomal 43S pre-initiation complex directly to the initiation codon and eliminates the requirement for eIF4F [1]. The classical swine virus UTR described in [1] appears to be longer at the 5' end than other pestivirus UTRs. This family represents the conserved core.

The mammalian c-myc gene is a proto-oncogene which is required for cell proliferation, transformation and death. c-myc mRNA has an alternative method of translation via internal ribosome entry where ribosomes are recruited to the IRES located in the 5' UTR thus bypassing the typical eukaryotic cap-dependent translation pathway [1].

The Arabidopsis homologue is annotated as snoR41 in the sequence databases. U43 is hypothesised to guide methylation of 2'-O-ribose residues on 18S ribosomal RNA [1]. This family represents mammalian U43.
RF00222	IRES_Bag1	Bag-1 internal ribosome entry site (IRES)	Cis-reg; IRES;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents the bag-1 internal ribosome entry site (IRES). When expressed the BAG-1 protein is known to enhance the anti-apoptotic properties of Bcl-2. Although bag-1 translation usually occurs via a cap-dependent mechanism it has been found to contain a IRES in its 5' UTR. Translation via the IRES has been found to be common following heat shock when cap-dependent scanning is compromised [1].
RF00223	IRES_Bip	bip internal ribosome entry site (IRES)	Cis-reg; IRES;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents the bip internal ribosome entry site (IRES).

When expressed the FGF-2 protein plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival as well as being involved in wound-healing [1,2]. It has been found that FGF-2 IRES activity is strictly controlled and highly tissue specific. It is thought that translational IRES dependent activation of FGF-2 plays a vital role in embryogenesis and in the adult brain [1].
RF00225	IRES_Tobamo	Tobamovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES)	Cis-reg; IRES;	Viruses; 	This family represents the Tobamovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES).

The IRES achieves this by mediating the internal initiation of translation by recruiting a ribosomal 43S pre-initiation complex directly to the initiation codon and eliminates the requirement for eIF4F [2].
RF00226	IRES_n-myc	n-myc internal ribosome entry site (IRES)	Cis-reg; IRES;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents the n-myc internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The myc family of genes when expressed are known to be involved in the control of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. n-myc mRNA has an alternative method of translation via internal ribosome entry where ribosomes are recruited to the IRES located in the 5' UTR thus bypassing the typical eukaryotic cap-dependent translation pathway [1].
RF00227	FIE3	FIE3 (ftz instability element 3') element	Cis-reg;	Eukaryota; 	The fushi tarazu gene is essential for the establishment of the Drosophila embryonic body plan. When first expressed in early embryogenesis, fushi tarazu mRNA is uniformly distributed over most of the embryo. Subsequently, fushi tarazu mRNA expression rapidly evolves into a pattern of seven stripes that encircle the embryo. The instability of fushi tarazu mRNA is probably crucial for attaining this localised pattern of expression [1]. Experiments provide evidence for at least two destabilising elements in the fushi tarazu mRNA, one located within the 5' one-third of the mRNA and the other near the 3' end (termed FIE3 for ftz instability element 3'). The FIE3 lies within a 201-nucleotide sequence just upstream of the polyadenylation signal and can act autonomously to destabilise a heterologous mRNA. Further deletion constructs identified an essential 68-nucleotide element within the FIE3 [1].

IRES elements allow cap and end-independent translation of mRNA in the host cell. The IRES achieves this by mediating the internal initiation of translation by recruiting a ribosomal 43S pre-initiation complex directly to the initiation codon and eliminates the requirement for eIF4F [2].

RF00373	RNaseP_arch	Archaeal RNase P	Gene; ribozyme;	Bacteria; Archaea; 	Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Its best characterised activity is the generation of mature 5'-ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5'-leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzymes have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous -- helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.

RF00381	Antizyme_FSE	Antizyme RNA frameshifting stimulation element	Cis-reg; frameshift_element;	Eukaryota; 	This family represents a structural element which is found in antizyme mRNA and is known to promote frameshifting. Antizyme genes have have two partially overlapping open reading frames, the second, which encodes the functional protein requires +1 translational frameshifting. This frameshift is stimulated by a pseudoknot present 3' of the frameshift site in the antizyme mRNA. The frameshifting efficiency is dependent on the level of polyamines in the cell, when the polyamine concentration is high frameshifting is more likely to occur which leads to an increase in the quantity of functional antizyme produced.

The complete human U12-22/U4-8 scaRNA is composed of two tandem C/D box domains (termed U12-22 and U4-8). The 5' and 3' C/D domains are predicted to guide the 2'O-ribose methylation of residue U22 in U12 (RFAM:RF00007) and residue C8 in U4 (RFAM:RF00015) snRNAs respectively [1].

Both the doublet (U12-22/U4-8) and singlet (U4-8) forms of this snRNA have been purified from Hela cells [1]. The doublet form U12-22/U4-8 has been shown to localise to the nucleoplasm and is proposed to reside in the Cajal bodies whereas the U4-8 single domain appears to accumulate in the nucleolus [1]. In humans the genomic location of U12-88/U4-8 is intergenic and the purified transcript has been shown to possess a methylated guanosine cap suggesting it is independently transcribed by RNA pol II [1].

Glycine riboswitches usually consist of two metabolite-binding aptamers domains with similar structures in tandem. The aptamers cooperatively bind glycine to regulate the expression of downstream genes. In Bacillus subtilis, this riboswitch is found upstream of the gcvT operon which controls glycine degradation. It is thought that when glycine is in excess it will bind to both aptamers to activate these genes and facilitate glycine degradation [1].

RF00506	Thr_leader	Threonine operon leader	Cis-reg; leader;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	At least 6 amino acid operons are known to be regulated by attenuation [1]. In each a leader sequence of 150-200 bp is found upstream of the first gene in the operon. This leader sequence can assume two different secondary structures known as the terminator and the anti-terminator structure. In each case the leader also codes for very short peptide sequence that is rich in the end product amino acid of the operon. The terminator structure is recognised as a termination signal for RNA polymerase and the operon is not transcribed. This structure forms when the cell has an excess of the regulatory amino acid and ribosome movement over the leader transcript is not impeded [1]. When there is a deficiency of the charged tRNA of the regulatory amino acid the ribosome translating the leader peptide stalls and the antiterminator structure can form. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon [1]. In the Rfam alignment the consensus structure is of the terminator. The alternative consensus structure is the antiterminator structure.

In each case the leader also codes for very short peptide sequence that is rich in the end product amino acid of the operon. The terminator structure is recognised as a termination signal for RNA polymerase and the operon is not transcribed. This structure forms when the cell has an excess of the regulatory amino acid and ribosome movement over the leader transcript is not impeded [1]. When there is a deficiency of the charged tRNA of the regulatory amino acid the ribosome translating the leader peptide stalls and the antiterminator structure can form. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon [1]. In the Rfam alignment the consensus structure is of the terminator. The alternative consensus structure is the antiterminator structure.

U106 contains conserved antisense elements which would predict U106 methylates residues G1536 and U1602 of 18S rRNA. However, these targets do not appear to be methylated and U106 might function as an RNA chaperone during rRNA folding [1]. A similar role has been suggested for the H/ACA snoRNAs U17a and U17b Rfam:RF00045 [1].

RF00617	cHP	flavivirus capsid hairpin cHP	Cis-reg;	Viruses; 	cHP is a conserved RNA hairpin structure identified within the capsid coding region of several flavivirus genomes. These positive strand RNA genomes are translated as a single polypeptide and subsequently cleaved into constituent proteins, the first of which is the capsid protein. The cHP hairpin is located within the capsid coding region between two AUG start codons. The cHP cis element has been shown to direct translation start from the thermodynamically unstable first start codon [1]. The ability of cHP to direct initiation from the first start codon is proportional to its thermodynamic stability, is position dependent, and is sequence independent [1]. It has been demonstrated that both AUGs and the conserved cHP are necessary for efficient viral replication in human and mosquito cells [1].
RF00618	U4atac	U4atac minor spliceosomal RNA	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	Eukaryota; 	U4atac is an essential component of the minor U12-type spliceosome complex which is required for removal of the rarer class of eukaryotic introns (AT-AC, U12-type) [1]. U4atac snRNA is proposed to form a base-paired complex with another spliceosomal RNA U6atac via two stem loop regions. These interacting stem loops have been shown to be required for in vivo splicing [2]. U4atac also contains an 3' Sm protein binding site which has been shown to be essential for splicing activity [2]. U4atac is the functional analog of U4 (Rfam:RF00015) in the major U2-type spliceosomal complex [2].

These stem loops are located downstream of the IRES site but their functional role is unknown [1].
RF00621	CoTC_ribozyme	Beta-globin co-transcriptional cleavage ribozyme	Gene; ribozyme;	Eukaryota; 	Transcription termination of RNA polymerase II transcripts is proposed to occur by a two stage process [1]. The first stage involves pre-termination cleavage (PTC) of the nascent transcript downstream of the poly(A) site. This process is also referred to as co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC). The CoTC process in the human beta-globin gene has been shown to involve an RNA self-cleaving activity located in the 3' flanking region of the beta-globin gene. This Rfam model represents the catalytic core of the beta-globin CoTC ribozyme. The CoTC core is highly conserved in the 3' flanking regions of other primate beta-globin genes [2]. Functionally, this CoTC ribozyme resembles the 3' processive, self-cleaving ribozymes described for the protein-encoding genes from the myxomycetes Didymium iridis and Physarum polycephalum [2].

This ribozyme is highly conserved and found only in mammals [1]. The CPEB3 ribozyme is structurally and biochemically related to the human hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme (Rfam:RF00094) and the HDV ribozyme is proposed to have arisen from the human transcriptome [1]. There is currently only one other known self cleaving ribozyme in mammals, the CoTC motif (Rfam:RF00621)[2].

P24 has a predicted Rho independent terminator at the 3' end but the function of P24 is unknown [1].
RF00630	P26	Pseudomonas sRNA P26	Gene;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; 	This small RNA (sRNA) was computationally identified in the genome of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its expression verified by northern blot analysis [1].

RF00684	mir-122	mir-122 microRNA precursor	Gene; miRNA;	Eukaryota; 	miR-122 is miRNA precursor family MIPF:MIPF0000095 that appears to be vertebrate specific. In mammals, miR-122 is enriched in liver cells where it has been implicated as a regulator of fatty-acid metabolism in mouse studies. The hairpin precursors (represented here) are predicted based on base pairing and cross-species conservation -- their extents are not known. In this case the mature sequence is excised from the 5' arm of the hairpin.

The ROSE element is a negative regulator of heat shock gene expression. The secondary structure is thought to be regulated by temperature. This regulation blocks access to the ribosome binding site under normal conditions. During heat shock however, the structure changes freeing the ribosome binding site and allowing expression to occur [1,2]. This family includes predicted members of the family from gamma-proteobacteria.

RF01846	Fungi_U3	Fungal small nucleolar RNA U3	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Eukaryota; 	Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in the processing and modification of rRNA in the nucleolus. There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localisation, stability and hyper-methylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.

Its role is to liberate the mRNA from a stalled ribosome. To accomplish this part of the tmRNA is used as a reading frame that ends in a translation stop signal. The broken mRNA is replaced in the ribosome by the tmRNA and translation of the tmRNA leads to addition of a proteolysis tag to the incomplete protein enabling recognition by a protease. Recently a number of permuted tmRNA genes have been found encoded in two parts. tmRNAs have been identified in eubacteria and some chloroplasts but are absent from archaeal and eukaryote nuclear genomes.

RF01854	Bacteria_large_SRP	Bacterial large signal recognition particle RNA	Gene;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Archaea; 	The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA (RFAM:RF00017) and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most bacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) have a longer eukaryote-like SRP RNA that includes an Alu domain [2]. The Alu domain of the longer SRP RNAs is not included in this model and therefore the reported bounds of some members are incorrect. The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) [1] provides compilations of SRP components, with phylogenetic data and structural illustrations.

It is a large, infrequently spliced RNA, which is highly conserved amongst mammals. It is highly expressed in the nucleus [1]. It is associated with metastasis, and positively regulates cell motility via the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional regulation of motility-related genes [2].
RF01872	MEG3_2	Maternally expressed 3 conserved region 2	Gene; lncRNA;	Eukaryota; 	MEG3 (maternally expressed 3) is a maternally expressed, imprinted noncoding RNA gene. At least 12 different isoforms of MEG3 are generated by alternative splicing [1]. Expression of MEG3 is lost in cancer cells [1,2]. It acts as a growth suppressor in tumour cells, and activates p53 [2,3].

RF01879	TUSC7	Non-coding RNA LOC285194	Gene; lncRNA;	Eukaryota; 	LOC285194 is a non-coding RNA which is often deleted in osteosarcoma. Deletion of this gene is associated with poor survival of osteosarcoma patients. It may act as a growth suppressor in osteoblasts [1].
RF01880	Xist_exon1	X-chromosome inactivation gene exon 1	Gene; lncRNA;	Eukaryota; 	Xist is an RNA gene on the X chromosome of the placental mammals that acts as major effector of the X inactivation process. The Xist RNA, a large (17 kb in humans) [1] transcript, is expressed on the inactive chromosome and not on the active one. It is processed similarly to mRNAs, through splicing and polyadenylation, however, it remains untranslated. It has been suggested that this RNA gene evolved at least partly from a protein coding gene that became a pseudogene [2]. The inactive X is coated with this transcript, which is essential for the inactivation.

RF01881	Xist_exon4	X-chromosome inactivation gene exon 4	Gene; lncRNA;	Eukaryota; 	Xist is an RNA gene on the X chromosome of the placental mammals that acts as major effector of the X inactivation process. The Xist RNA, a large (17 kb in humans) [1] transcript, is expressed on the inactive chromosome and not on the active one. It is processed similarly to mRNAs, through splicing and polyadenylation, however, it remains untranslated. It has been suggested that this RNA gene evolved at least partly from a protein coding gene that became a pseudogene [2]. The inactive X is coated with this transcript, which is essential for the inactivation. X lacking Xist will not be inactivated, while duplication of the Xist gene on another chromosome causes inactivation of that chromosome. This Xist exon was identified in a screen for conserved and structured elements in the human genome [3].

RF02005	group-II-D1D4-6	Group II catalytic intron D1-D4-6	Intron;	Eukaryota; Bacteria; Archaea; 	Group II introns are found in rRNA, tRNA and mRNA of organelles in fungi, plants and protists, and also in mRNA in bacteria. They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI. This model and alignment represents only domains V and VI. A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon.
